The goal of this project is to develop software that interfaces with Honeywell RWD80/T Water Defense Water Sensing Alarm Extension Cable. 

I've already developed a circuit that reliably kicks out 3.3v whenever the cable touches water, so I'm going to interface it with the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi, and then extend that to the Mozilla IoT project for alerting and other features.
